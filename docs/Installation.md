# Installation

Releases of FlexDMD come with the following files ;
- FlexDMDUI.exe
- FlexDMD.dll
- FlexUDMD.dll

Beside these files, you will need ```DMDDevice.dll``` for 32 bits rendering, and ```DMDDevice64.dll``` for 64 bits rendering. There can be different flavors of these. The ones used for developping FlexDMD are [Freezy's DMD Extensions](https://github.com/freezy/dmd-extensions). The "Release" section will provide you with the needed files.

The FlexDMDUI.exe application allows you to install the different parts and test them. So just launch it, check it finds all the needed files (first panel), then simply press ```register``` (second pane) for the FlexDMD extension, and, if you want it, just press ```register``` (third pane) for the UltraDMD replacement.

Finally, switch from the 'Installer' tab to the 'Designer' tab, select the output you want to test between FlexDMD, UltraDMD or both, and press 'Run'.
